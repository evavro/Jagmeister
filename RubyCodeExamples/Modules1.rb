# Example: Demonstrates use of Comparable module
#
# The Comparable module/mixin is used by classes whose objects may be ordered.
# The class must define the <=> operator, which compares the receiver against
# another object, returning -1, 0, or +1 depending on whether the receiver
# is less than, equal to, or greater than the other object. If the other
# object is not comparable then the <=> operator should return nil.
# Comparable uses <=> to implement the conventional comparison operators
# (<, <=, ==, >=, and >) and the method between?. Ruby implements != operator
# as a negation of == operator.
